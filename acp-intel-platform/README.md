## Overview

Every enterprise with a contact center eventually faces a technology decision — migrate to CCaaS, deploy AI, overhaul QA, modernize workforce management. These are complex, high-stakes purchases involving 50–200+ vendors across 50+ solution categories. Most buyers navigate this alone, spending 3–12 months and $50K–$500K+ on evaluations they're unqualified to run.

**This platform identifies those buyers before they start searching**, scores their urgency using a six-factor strain model, and routes them to the right CTG Guru at the right moment — turning reactive lead generation into predictive pipeline manufacturing.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Scored Prospects | 30 across 7 industry verticals |
| Total Pipeline | $51.9M annual CC spend |
| Pipeline Value | $8.2M / $1.4M/yr projected commission |
| Hot Prospects | 9 representing $27.5M annual CC spend |
| End-to-End Latency | 2–6 hours (signal → scored prospect with outreach brief) |
| Detection Accuracy | 94% |
| Data Sources | 62 across 9 intelligence categories |

---

## Technical Architecture

### Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript | Zero framework dependencies |
| Architecture | Modular SPA | Hash-based routing, module `init()`/`destroy()` lifecycle |
| Design System | Obsidian | Custom dark-mode tokens in `obsidian.css` — WCAG AA compliant |
| Components | 20+ shared components | `shared-components.js` — KPI cards, tier badges, radar charts, circular scores |
| Orchestration | n8n | Workflow engine managing agent chain, credential rotation, rate limiting |
| AI Classification | Claude API | Signal type classification at 94% detection accuracy |
| Enrichment | 12 parallel APIs | ~3 seconds per prospect for full firmographic/technographic enrichment |
| Hosting | Netlify | Static deployment, zero server-side dependencies |

### Design System — Obsidian Tokens

The platform uses a purpose-built dark-mode design system. Core tokens from `css/obsidian.css`:

```
Backgrounds:  #09090B (page) → #111113 (surface) → #18181B (elevated)
Text:         #FAFAFA (19.6:1) → #A1A1AA (7.4:1) → #71717A (4.6:1) → #52525B (decorative)
Accents:      Emerald #34D399 | Red #EF4444 | Amber #F59E0B | Blue #3B82F6 | Violet #A78BFA | Teal #14B8A6
Typography:   Plus Jakarta Sans (UI) | JetBrains Mono (data)
```

Tier colors: 🔴 HOT (Red) · 🟡 WARM (Amber) · 🟢 NURTURE (Teal) · 🔵 STRATEGIC (Blue)

### SPA Module System

Each section is a self-contained module loaded lazily via `app.js`. Modules register with the global namespace and implement the `init()`/`destroy()` contract:

```javascript
// Module registry in app.js
var MODULES = {
  'command-center':     { css: 'css/command-center.css',     js: 'js/command-center.js',     accent: 'emerald' },
  'pipeline-intel':     { css: 'css/pipeline-intel.css',     js: 'js/pipeline-intel.js',     accent: 'emerald' },
  'strain-simulator':   { css: 'css/strain-simulator.css',   js: 'js/strain-simulator.js',   accent: 'emerald' },
  'revenue-model':      { css: 'css/revenue-model.css',      js: 'js/revenue-model.js',      accent: 'emerald' },
  'agent-architecture': { css: 'css/agent-architecture.css', js: 'js/agent-architecture.js', accent: 'blue'    },
  'competitive-map':    { css: 'css/competitive-map.css',    js: 'js/competitive-map.js',    accent: 'red'     },
  'build-roadmap':      { css: 'css/build-roadmap.css',      js: 'js/build-roadmap.js',      accent: 'amber'   }
};
```

Hash-based routing (`#command-center`, `#pipeline-intel`, etc.) drives navigation. CSS is injected once per module on first load. The shell manages sidebar tab activation via `Shell.activateNavTab()`.

## Five Autonomous AI Agents

Five agents coordinated through an n8n orchestration layer. Each has a defined mission, clear triggers, and measurable outputs. Human review gates every outreach action — this is intelligence augmentation, not sales automation.

```

| Agent | Role | Triggers | Output |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| **Scout** — THE EYES | Signal detection | Job postings, RFPs, contract expirations, leadership changes, vendor EOL notices | Raw classified signals (10 types) |
| **Analyst** — THE BRAIN | Scoring & enrichment | New signals from Scout | Scored prospect profiles (0–100 Strain Index), tier crossings, enriched firmographics |
| **Strategist** — THE VOICE | Outreach generation | Tier crossings (especially → HOT) | Contextual outreach briefs, channel/timing recommendations, Guru matching |
| **Planner** — THE CALCULATOR | Revenue modeling | New scored prospects | Commission projections, conversion probability, portfolio risk assessment |
| **Monitor** — THE MEMORY | Feedback loop | Engagement outcomes | Model weight calibration, prediction accuracy tracking |

**Signal Chain:** Scout detects → Analyst scores → tier crossing detected → Strategist generates outreach brief → Guru assigned → outcome tracked → Monitor feeds back → model improves. Runs continuously.

**End-to-end latency:** 2–6 hours from raw signal (e.g., a LinkedIn job posting) to a Guru receiving a personalized engagement package with the prospect's strain profile, competitive landscape, and recommended approach angle.

## Sourcing Strain Index — Scoring Model

Every contact center technology buyer follows a predictable arc: pain accumulates, internal attempts fail, urgency spikes, they seek outside help. The Strain Index scores where each prospect sits on this arc.

### Six Weighted Factors

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures | Max Signal |
|--------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Vendor Universe Size | 20 pts | Number of vendors in prospect's space | 100+ vendors = max complexity |
| Evaluation Complexity | 20 pts | Technical depth of buying decision | Multi-platform + AI + analytics |
| Timeline Pressure | 20 pts | Months until decision required | ≤3 months = max urgency |
| Internal Expertise Gap | 15 pts | Domain knowledge to evaluate options | Score 4–5 = no internal expertise |
| Compliance Burden | 15 pts | Regulatory requirements | HIPAA + PCI + SOC2 = triple layer |
| Stakeholder Complexity | 10 pts | Decision-makers involved | 7+ stakeholders = consensus paralysis |

### Composite Formula

```
Strain Index = vendorUniverse(0.20) + evalComplexity(0.20) + timelinePressure(0.20)
             + expertiseGap(0.15) + complianceBurden(0.15) + stakeholders(0.10)
```

### Tier Thresholds

| Tier | Range | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 **HOT** | 75–100 | Decision imminent — immediate Guru engagement |
| 🟡 **WARM** | 50–74 | Actively evaluating — active outreach |
| 🟢 **NURTURE** | 25–49 | Building relationship — content + touchpoints |
| 🔵 **STRATEGIC** | 0–24 | Long-term target — monitor and nurture |

### Hours Saved Calculation

```
Evaluation Hours Eliminated = Vendor Universe × 4.5 hours × 70% reduction
```

A prospect facing 120 vendors = ~378 hours of evaluation work CTG absorbs.

## Intelligence Sourcing Pipeline

The platform doesn't wait for prospects to self-identify. It monitors external data sources, detects buying signals, enriches with context, scores against the Strain Index, and routes through the agent chain.

## Competitive Positioning

CTG displaces four alternatives — all of which it outperforms on specialization, speed, cost, and coverage:

| Alternative | Market Share | Their Weakness | CTG's Counter |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| DIY / Direct Buying | 55% | 200+ vendors, no leverage, 3–6 months of VP time | $0 cost, 200+ vendors evaluated, 2-week shortlist |
| Enterprise Consultancies | 15% | $200K+ engagements, generalist teams | Specialist Gurus with 20+ years CC experience |
| Other TSDs / Channel | 20% | 20–40 vendor portfolios, not CC-specialized | 50+ categories, 90 CC-focused specialists |
| BPO Advisory Firms | 10% | Narrow scope, often vendor-biased | Vendor-neutral, full-stack CC coverage |

### Revenue Model

```
Commission = Avg Seats per Deal × License Cost per Seat × 12 months × Commission Rate
Guru receives 80% | CTG retains 20% | Revenue compounds — Year 1 deals pay in perpetuity
```

From the live demo: 9 hot prospects represent $27.5M in annual CC spend. At 15% commission rate = **$4.1M/yr addressable commission** on the hot tier alone.

## Deployment

No build step. No bundler. No transpiler. Zero dependencies.

```bash
# Local development
open index.html
# or
npx serve .

# Netlify deployment
# Push to connected Git repo — Netlify auto-deploys from main branch
# Or manual deploy via Netlify CLI:
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **Zero-dependency frontend** — Vanilla JS eliminates build tooling, version conflicts, and framework churn
2. **Module lifecycle contract** — Every section implements `init()`/`destroy()` for clean memory management
3. **Source-agnostic ingestion** — New data sources require only an n8n connector node and signal-type mapping
4. **Human-in-the-loop** — Every outreach action passes through a human review gate
5. **Closed-loop intelligence** — Monitor agent feeds outcomes back to calibrate scoring weights
6. **Perpetual revenue architecture** — Year 1 deals compound; commission pays in perpetuity
